Absolutely! Since you already have an HTML canvas where users draw freely and you're saving the mouse positions, then checking all angles made by every 3-point combination — you're on the right track toward detecting shapes based on corner-like behavior.

Let me break it down with a visual illustration-style explanation of what’s happening when computing the angles between sets of three points.

🎨 Imagine this drawing:
Say a user draws a rough triangle:

    A
   / \

 C-----B
Let’s assume the points collected by mouse movement along this triangle include:

scss

Edit
A (100, 50)
B (150, 100)
C (50, 100)
You save these as part of a list of mouse positions. For simplification, let’s say we take only these three.

📐 Angle Computation Logic
To determine if these form a corner (or how “sharp” it is), for every combination of three consecutive points, you compute the angle at the middle one.

So for points A, B, C, you look at:

angle = ∠ABC
Where:

AB is a vector from B to A

CB is a vector from B to C

You use the dot product formula to get the angle:

angle
=
cos

)
angle=cos 
−1
 ( 
∣ 
BA
 ∣⋅∣ 
BC
 ∣
BA
 ⋅ 
BC
 
​
 )
This gives you the interior angle at point B.

If you compute this for every 3-point set in the path, sharp turns (like corners) will produce angles significantly different from 180° (which is a straight line). For triangles, you'll get three distinct corners with angles summing to ~180°.

🌀 Circle vs Triangle (Behavioral Example)
Circle: As the user draws, the angle between every set of 3 points stays close to 180°, because a circle has smooth curvature.

Triangle: You’ll find three points where the angle sharply deviates (like 30°, 60°, 90°). These are your corners!

💡 Visual Summary
Here’s a rough sketch of what’s going on behind the scenes:

Mouse path: [P0, P1, P2, ..., Pn]

For i in 1 to n-1:
    Compute angle at Pi using (Pi-1, Pi, Pi+1)

If angle at Pi is very small (sharp):
    Likely a corner of a polygon (e.g., triangle)

If angles are all near 180°:
    Likely part of a smooth curve (e.g., circle)









Great follow-up! When you're collecting lots of points during free drawing on canvas, that’s totally normal — but yes, it can overwhelm your shape detection logic and make angle calculation noisy.

To simplify your path while keeping the shape recognizable (especially corners), here are some solid strategies:

🧹 1. Point Reduction (Path Simplification)
Use an algorithm like:

🟠 Ramer–Douglas–Peucker (RDP) Algorithm
This is perfect for your case. It reduces a series of points to a simplified version by preserving the main structure (like corners or curves) and removing points that fall on straight-ish lines.

Keeps corners

Removes redundant middle points

Works beautifully for shape detection

👉 JavaScript RDP Implementation:
You can use libraries like simplify-js

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install simplify-js
js
Copy
Edit
import simplify from 'simplify-js';

const rawPoints = [
  { x: 100, y: 50 },
  { x: 101, y: 52 },
  { x: 102, y: 55 },
  ...
];

const simplified = simplify(rawPoints, 2.5); // 2.5 = tolerance (tune this!)
The higher the tolerance, the more aggressive the reduction. Start with 2.5 or 3 and tweak based on your canvas resolution.

🌀 2. Angle Thresholding (Optional Pre-Filter)
Before applying RDP, you could also:

Only keep a new point if the angle between the last 3 points differs by more than X degrees

Or if the distance from the last saved point is more than some threshold

Example:

js
Copy
Edit
function shouldAddPoint(prev, current, threshold = 5) {
  const dx = current.x - prev.x;
  const dy = current.y - prev.y;
  return Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy) > threshold;
}
📐 3. Post-Simplification Angle Detection
After reducing points:

Run your existing angle-checking logic on the simplified array.

You’ll now detect only key angles (e.g., triangle corners), not jitter from a shaky hand.
